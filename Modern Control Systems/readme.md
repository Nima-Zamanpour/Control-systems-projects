This Repository contains the Matlab files (including .m and Simulink) for the implementation of a state-space control system in Mag-Lev trains as the final project of the Modern Control Systems course.
The project is made of several parts:
1. **Given the system state equations, Equilibrium points are found.**
2. **The system is Linearized around the equilibrium point, and a state matrix is formed.**
3. **Systems stability is checked from its eigenvalues**
4. **System controllability and observability is checked, and a minimal realization is introduced.**
5. **State-transition matrix is calculated.**
6. **A transfer function matrix is calculated, and a PID controller is designed to control the output of both linear and non-linear systems.**
7. **State feedback and Integral controller are designed and tested in a noisy environment.**
8. **A full rank and a reduced rank Luenberger estimator are designed and tested on both linear and non-linear systems.**
